## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.

## OUTPUT
## X AXIS ASSEMBLY

#### SMOOTH ROD :
It is guide rail component made up of hardened-steel or chrome plated steel .it smoothness ensures precise and consistent movement which is needed to produce accurate and high quality models

#### BEARING :
Linear bearings are typically used in conjunction with smooth rods,they are used to reduce friction . linear motion and rotational motion-ball bearing

#### IDLER :
The idler pulley helps to guide the belt along its path, reducing the chances of the belt slipping or jumping teeth and causing print defects.

#### EXTRUDER :
Extruder is used to melting and extruding the filament onto the print bed

#### MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

## Y AXIS ASSEMBLY
![ex3 yaxis](https://github.com/22008837/Ex.-No.-3---SIMULATION-OF-CARTESIAN-3D-PRINTER-MACHINE/assets/120194155/3c54992e-7fb0-4072-a465-728d7de8775a)

#### Y AXIS SUPPORTER
The Y-axis supporter must be designed to withstand the forces generated during printing and maintain the printer's accuracy and stability.

#### Horiz. & Vertical Threaded Rod :
The horizontal threaded rod is typically used to hold the pulley that drives the movement of the print bed along the Y-axis.The vertical threaded rod is typically used to control the Z-axis movement of the print bed

#### SMOOTH ROD :
The use of smooth rods in the printer's Y-axis mechanism helps to provide smooth and precise movement of the print bed

#### PULLEY :
pulley is often used in the Y-axis mechanism to transfer motion from the printer's stepper motor to the print bed.

#### MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes

#### Y AXIS FRAME :
It is responsible for support and stability of y axis frame.and also z axis.

#### Y AXIS BASE :
The Y-axis base is responsible for providing stability and support to the entire printer's structure, including the Y-axis frame, the print bed, and the printed object.

## Z AXIS ASSEMBLY

#### Z AXIS ROD :
The z-axis rod is responsible for supporting the weight of the print head and controlling its movement as it moves up and down during the printing process

#### Z AXIS TOP COVER :
The primary purpose of the z-axis top cover is to prevent dust and debris from settling on the z-axis rod, which can cause damage to the rod and the bearings that guide it

#### MOTOR :
motor is help to movement of the print head along x,y,z axes.

## COMPLETE ASSEMBLY

#### FRAME :
rigid structure that holds all the other components of the printer.

#### Y AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Y-axis is responsible for moving the print bed back and forth along the horizontal axis.

#### Z AXIS ASSEMBLY :
The Z-axis is responsible for moving the print head up and down along the vertical axis.

## PLAYING WITH AXES
